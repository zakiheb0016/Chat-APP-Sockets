#Description:
This is a chat application developed using the C programming language to experiment with sockets in Linux.

#Functionality:
The application consists of two sub-applications, one for the client side and another for the server side. The conversation is initiated by the client, who sends a message to the server. The server responds to the message, and the conversation continues until one of them sends the 'EXIT' command to terminate the session.
